Arcana Suprema is a content mod wich adds new ores, soundtracks, items, weapons, npcs, enemies and bosses. All of wich are related to magic and alchemy.
Your objective with this mod is to craft basic alchemical spells until you achieve your personal opus magnum ... the "Arcana Suprema", the definitive spell to rule over all Terraria.

The mod currently contains:

* +8 Items *
* +1 Buff *


Note: This mod contains mainly Mage improving items, but do not worry my fellow Warrior or Ranger (... or Thrower) there are plenty of useful items and accesories that you can use, even if you are a complete incompetent with everything related to magic!!!
